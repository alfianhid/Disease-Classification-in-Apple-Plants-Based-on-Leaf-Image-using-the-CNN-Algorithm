# Disease-Classification-in-Apple-Plants-Based-on-Leaf-Image-using-the-CNN-Algorithm

In biology, a plant can be determined condition is healthy or not through their morphological characteristics. One that can be used as a reference is the morphology on the leaf surface. Plants that are affected by certain diseases will show anomalies on the surface of their leaves. So that the leaves of these plants will be different from the leaves of healthy plants in general. This can be a reference for us to create a disease identification system in plants based on leaf images by utilizing Machine Learning algorithms.

This repository contains scripts or source code on how to classify diseases in apple plants based on leaf images using one of the Deep Learning algorithms, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN is a Deep Learning model that is often used to classify an image in JPG file format.
